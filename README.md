# QuestCraft
![QC](/QCSimple3.jpg)

QuestCraft, utilizing Vivecraft and Pojlib, is a standalone port of Minecraft: Java Edition to Oculus Quest Headsets. With a team of four main developers and 8 third party developers, over the past year we have not only gotten the bestselling game, Minecraft: Java Edition running on Android, but we have also worked with third-party developers to bring it into Virtual Reality on the Oculus Quest line of standalone HMDs.

- ### **Includes a Unity and Pojlib-built *launcher* that allows you to start QuestCraft, switch between versions and renderers, and use Mod Manager, a tool to download and install supported mods right from your Quest!!**

# Installation Instructions

**NOTE: In order to install QuestCraft, you must have an internet connection in order for the initial setup to succeed. Furthermore, you MUST own a legal, valid copy of Minecraft: Java Edition to play!**

First off, you most likely want to install QuestCraft. Please go to the release page for **[QuestCraft](https://github.com/QuestCraftPlusPlus/QuestCraft/releases/latest)** and download the APK to your computer or Android device.

Secondly, you need to install the QuestCraft APK to your VR Headset using **[SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com)** and follow the necessary steps to connect your Quest. Drag and drop the APK, and wait for it to install.

Next, open the QuestCraft launcher on your headset. Be sure to grant it all requested permissions. Once complete, follow the on-screen prompts to enter your Minecraft login details and wait for QuestCraft to download any remaining files (seen in the bottom-right).

And boom! You have successfully installed QuestCraft on your VR headset! To play, simply press the **Play** button and wait for it to load, it might take a while depending on headset age and model.

## Supported Renderers (Take note when installing mods!)
### **We have a [list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12yUTO_HgAEyZFoETxmzqaxPZrOUF1ocaQjbi_u5U2jI/edit?usp=sharing) that contains supported mods that are not in the ModManager! You can also add to this list with this [form](https://forms.gle/TRU7NN4YdgR4oDeW9)!**
These are renderers that you can toggle on anytime. Each of them comes with their own benefits. **Note that GL4ES and Zink already have performance mods installed. (see [the mod list.)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12yUTO_HgAEyZFoETxmzqaxPZrOUF1ocaQjbi_u5U2jI/edit?usp=sharing)**
- ### GL4ES
GL4ES (**[OpenGL ES](https://www.khronos.org/opengles/#)**) has moderate speed, with moderate mod compatibility. Complex mods like Distant Horizons and Immersive Portals may not work.
- ### Zink
**[Zink](https://docs.mesa3d.org/drivers/zink.html)**, while being primarily slow, has great mod compatibility. Complex mods like Distant Horizons and Immersive Portals will work.
- ### Vulkan
**[Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/)**, while being very fast, has low mod compatibility. Complex mods like Distant Horizons and Immersive Portals will work.


## Some Recommended Settings and Tips (For Zink and GL4ES)
1. In the options menu, go to VR Settings/Stereo Rendering and set the resolution (NOT CAMERA RES) to 80%. This will decrease the general quality, but will give an extra performance boost.
2. The game's render distance is best at 4. 5 works, but you may encounter lag spikes when using it. 6 and above, you are on your own.
3. Oceans contain LOTS of kelp that decrease framerate. Don't mine any of it all at once, as your game may CRASH if lots of entities (in this case, kelp waiting to be picked up) exist at once.
4. Skyblock and Oneblock worlds perform the best, as they have no world generator and typically have hardly anything to render.
