# Welcome to the QuestCraft Github!
[Support us here!](https://www.patreon.com/QuestCraftXR)

First off, you most likely want to install QuestCraft. If you would like to get going instantly then please go to the release page for [QuestCraft](https://github.com/QuestCraftPlusPlus/QuestCraft/releases/latest) and download the APK to your computer or mobile device.

For our developer friends, the QuestCraft Source Code lies in both the [MCXR](https://github.com/QuestCraftPlusPlus/MCXR) repo and [PojavLauncher](https://github.com/QuestCraftPlusPlus/PojavLauncher) repo. These contain everything needed to compile QuestCraft from source.
# Installation Instructions

**PLEASE NOTE: In order to install QuestCraft, you must have an Internet Connection in order for the inital setup to succeed. Furthermore, you MUST own a legal, valid copy of Minecraft: Java Edition to play!**

First, you need to install the QuestCraft APK to your VR Headset using [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com) (available on Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android) or with [QuestToolbox](https://github.com/mitchv2020/QuestToolbox) (Available on Windows, Auto Installer coming to QuestToolbox soon).

Next, open the QuestCraft launcher on your headset. Be sure to allow it to install any necessary files, and to grant it all requested permissions. Once complete, follow the on-screen prompts to enter your Minecraft login details and click the Install button to install QuestCraft's remaining required files.

And boom! You have successfully installed QuestCraft on your VR headset! To play, simply press the **Play** button and wait for it to load, it might take a while depending on headset age and model.

# Build Instructions

For building manually, please check out our [PojavLauncher](https://github.com/QuestCraftPlusPlus/PojavLauncher) repo and follow the instructions provided there. More in depth instructions for QCXR as a whole will be available soon.

# Misc
Miscellaneous information about questcraft, such as controls, or recommended mods. 

## Recommended mods

QuestCraft is fairly slow by itself because minecraft is a very badly optimized game. Here is a (not comprehensive) list of some recommended performance enhancing mods:
- [Cull Leaves](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cull-leaves) (Culls leaves that are behind other leaves)
- [Starlight](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/starlight) (Improves the lighting engine)
- [LazyDFU](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lazydfu) (Removes DFU Caching)
- [C^2M-Engine](https://github.com/RelativityMC/C2ME-fabric) (Speeds up chunk generation) (Back up your worlds before using!!)
- [Lithium](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lithium) (General purpose performance mod)

At the moment, Sodium, Iris, and Canvas do not work. We are working on porting sodium, if you would like to contribute, please make a PR for your work on our [Sodium](https://github.com/QuestCraftPlusPlus/sodium-fabric) repo.
